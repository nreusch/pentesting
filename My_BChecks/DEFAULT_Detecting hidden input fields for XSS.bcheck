            detail: "A Hidden Input Field has been Detected. It is recommended to manually check this field by appending them in the URL for potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities."
            remediation: "To prevent potential security risks, In most situations where user-controllable data is copied into application responses, cross-site scripting attacks can be prevented using two layers of defenses:
a) Input should be validated as strictly as possible on arrival, given the kind of content that it is expected to contain. For example, personal names should consist of alphabetical and a small range of typographical characters, and be relatively short; a year of birth should consist of exactly four numerals; email addresses should match a well-defined regular expression. Input which fails the validation should be rejected, not sanitized.
b) User input should be HTML-encoded at any point where it is copied into application responses. All HTML metacharacters, including < > \" \' and =, should be replaced with the corresponding HTML entities (&lt; &gt; etc)."
